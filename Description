Welcome to my CODSOFT Internship C++ Tasks repository! 
This repository contains the C++ programming tasks I completed during my internship at CODSOFT.
Each task showcases different aspects of C++ programming, demonstrating the skills and knowledge 
I developed throughout my internship.

Repository Contents :- 
Task 1: Number Guessing Game
Description:
This task involves creating a simple Number Guessing Game using C++. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number. It provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

Key Features:

a) Random number generation
b) User input and feedback loop
c) Use of ANSI escape codes for colored text output




Task 2: Simple Calculator
Description:
This task involves creating a Simple Calculator program using C++. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.

Key Features:

a) Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
b) User input validation
c) Menu-driven interface for user interaction
d) Use of ANSI escape codes for colored text output




Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Description:
This task involves creating a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using C++. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns to place their markers ("X" and "O") on the grid, and the game checks for win or draw conditions after each move.

Key Features:

a) 3x3 game board display
b) Two-player mode with alternating turns
c) Input validation for player moves
d) Check for win and draw conditions
e) User-friendly interface with colored text output



Task 4: To-Do List Manager
Description:
This task involves creating a simple console-based To-Do List Manager using C++. The program allows users to add, view, mark as completed, and delete tasks from their to-do list. The aim is to help users organize their tasks efficiently.

Key Features:

a) Add Task: Allows users to input tasks they want to add to the list.
b) View Tasks: Displays the list of tasks with their status (completed or pending).
c) Mark Task as Completed: Enables users to mark tasks as completed.
d) Remove Task: Provides an option to remove tasks from the list.
e) User Interface: Includes a user-friendly menu with clear instructions and colored text output.
