Repository Contents
Task 1: Number Guessing Game
Description:
This task involves creating a simple Number Guessing Game using C++. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number. It provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

Key Features:

Random number generation
User input and feedback loop
Use of ANSI escape codes for colored text output
Task 2: Simple Calculator
Description:
This task involves creating a Simple Calculator program using C++. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.

Key Features:

Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
User input validation
Menu-driven interface for user interaction
Use of ANSI escape codes for colored text output
Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Description:
This task involves creating a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe Game using C++. The game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their markers ("X" and "O") on the grid, with the game checking for win or draw conditions after each move.

Key Features:

3x3 game board display
Two-player mode with alternating turns
Input validation for player moves
Win and draw condition checks
User-friendly interface with colored text output
Task 4: To-Do List Manager
Description:
This task involves creating a simple console-based To-Do List Manager using C++. The program allows users to add, view, mark as completed, and delete tasks from their to-do list, helping users organize their tasks efficiently.

Key Features:

Add Task: Allows users to input tasks to the list
View Tasks: Displays the list of tasks with their status (completed or pending)
Mark Task as Completed: Enables users to mark tasks as completed
Remove Task: Provides an option to remove tasks from the list
User Interface: Includes a user-friendly menu with clear instructions and colored text output
